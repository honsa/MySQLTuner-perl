***WARNING***
--

It is **important** for you to fully understand each change
you make to a MySQL database server.  If you don't understand portions
of the script's output, or if you don't understand the recommendations,
**you should consult** a knowledgeable DBA or system administrator
that you trust.  **Always** test your changes on staging environments, and
always keep in mind that improvements in one area can **adversely affect**
MySQL in other areas.

It's **also important** to wait at least 24 hours of uptime to get accurate results. In fact, running
**mysqltuner** on a fresh restarted server is completely useless.

**Also review the FAQ section below.**

Security recommendations
--

Hi directadmin user!
We detected that you run mysqltuner with da_admin's credentials taken from `/usr/local/directadmin/conf/my.cnf`, which might bring to a password discovery!
Read link for more details [Issue #289](https://github.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl/issues/289).

What is MySQLTuner checking exactly ?
--

All checks done by **MySQLTuner** are documented in [MySQLTuner Internals](https://github.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl/blob/master/INTERNALS.md) documentation.

```

2) You can download the entire repository by using `git clone` or `git clone --depth 1 -b master` followed by the cloning URL above.

Optional Sysschema installation for MySQL 5.6
--

Sysschema is installed by default under MySQL 5.7 and MySQL 8 from Oracle.
By default, on MySQL 5.6/5.7/8, performance schema is enabled by default.
For previous MySQL 5.6 version, you can follow this command to create a new database sys containing very useful view on Performance schema:

Sysschema for MySQL old version
--

```bash
curl "https://codeload.github.com/mysql/mysql-sys/zip/master" > sysschema.zip
# check zip file
unzip -l sysschema.zip
unzip sysschema.zip
cd mysql-sys-master
mysql -uroot -p < sys_56.sql
```

Sysschema for MariaDB old version
--

```bash
curl "https://github.com/FromDual/mariadb-sys/archive/refs/heads/master.zip" > sysschema.zip
# check zip file
unzip -l sysschema.zip
unzip sysschema.zip
cd mariadb-sys-master
mysql -u root -p < ./sys_10.sql
```

Performance schema setup
--

By default, performance_schema is enabled and sysschema is installed on latest version.

By default, on MariaDB, performance schema is disabled by default (MariaDB<10.6).

Consider activating performance schema across your my.cnf configuration file:

```ini
[mysqld]
performance_schema = on
performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-history-long = ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-history = ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-current = ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-current=ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-history=ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-stages-history-long=ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-transactions-current=ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-transactions-history=ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-transactions-history-long=ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-current=ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-history=ON
performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-history-long=ON
performance-schema-instrument='%=ON'
max-digest-length=2048
performance-schema-max-digest-length=2018
```

Sysschema installation for MariaDB < 10.6
--

Sysschema is not installed by default under MariaDB prior to 10.6 [MariaDB sys](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/sys-schema/)

You can follow this command to create a new database sys containing a useful view on Performance schema:

```bash
curl "https://codeload.github.com/FromDual/mariadb-sys/zip/master" > mariadb-sys.zip
# check zip file
unzip -l mariadb-sys.zip
unzip mariadb-sys.zip
cd mariadb-sys-master/
mysql -u root -p < ./sys_10.sql
```

Errors & solutions for performance schema installation
--


ERROR 1054 (42S22) at line 78 in file: './views/p_s/metrics_56.sql': Unknown column 'STATUS' in 'field list'
--


This error can be safely ignored
Consider using a recent MySQL/MariaDB version to avoid this kind of issue during sysschema installation

In recent versions, sysschema is installed and integrated by default as sys schema (SHOW DATABASES)



ERROR at line 21: Failed to open file './tables/sys_config_data_10.sql -- ported', error: 2
Have a look at #452 solution given by @ericx
--

Fixing sysctl configuration (/etc/sysctl.conf)

--
It is a system wide setting and not a database setting: [Linux FS Kernel settings](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysctl/fs.html#id1)

You can check its values via:

```bash
$ cat /proc/sys/fs/aio-*
65536
2305
```

For example, to set the aio-max-nr value, add the following line to the /etc/sysctl.conf file:

```bash
fs.aio-max-nr = 1048576
```

To activate the new setting:

```bash
$ sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
```

Specific usage
--

__Usage:__ Minimal usage locally

```bash
perl mysqltuner.pl --host 127.0.0.1
```

Of course, you can add the execute bit (`chmod +x mysqltuner.pl`) so you can execute it without calling Perl directly.

__Usage:__ Minimal usage remotely

In previous version, --forcemem shoud be set manually, in order to be able to run an MySQLTuner analysis

Since 2.1.10, memory and swap are defined to 1Gb by default.

If you want a more accurate value according to your remote server, feel free to setup --forcemem and --forceswap to real RAM value

```bash
perl mysqltuner.pl --host targetDNS_IP --user admin_user --pass admin_password
```

__Usage:__ Enable maximum output information around MySQL/MariaDb without debugging

```bash
perl mysqltuner.pl --verbose
perl mysqltuner.pl --buffers --dbstat --idxstat --sysstat --pfstat --tbstat
```

__Usage:__ Enable CVE vulnerabilities check for your MariaDB or MySQL version

```bash
perl mysqltuner.pl --cvefile=vulnerabilities.csv
```

__Usage:__ Write your result in a file with information displayed

```bash
perl mysqltuner.pl --outputfile /tmp/result_mysqltuner.txt
```

__Usage:__ Write your result in a file **without outputting information**

```bash
perl mysqltuner.pl --silent --outputfile /tmp/result_mysqltuner.txt
```

__Usage:__ Using template model to customize your reporting file based on [Text::Template](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Template) syntax.

```bash
perl mysqltuner.pl --silent --reportfile /tmp/result_mysqltuner.txt --template=/tmp/mymodel.tmpl
```

__Important__: [Text::Template](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Template) module is mandatory for `--reportfile` and/or `--template` options, because this module is needed to generate appropriate output based on a text template.


__Usage:__ Dumping all information_schema and sysschema views as csv file into results subdirectory

```bash
perl mysqltuner.pl --verbose --dumpdir=./result
```


__Usage:__ Enable debugging information

```bash
perl mysqltuner.pl --debug
```

__Usage:__ Update MySQLTuner and data files (password and cve) if needed

```bash
perl mysqltuner.pl --checkversion --updateversion
```

FAQ
--
**Question: What are the prerequisites for running MySQL tuner ?**

Before running MySQL tuner, you should have the following:

 - A MySQL server installation
 - Perl installed on your system
 - Administrative access to your MySQL server

**Question: Can MySQL tuner make changes to my configuration automatically ?**

**No.**, MySQL tuner only provides recommendations. It does not make any changes to your configuration files automatically. It is up to the user to review the suggestions and implement them as needed.

**Question: How often should I run MySQL tuner ?**

It is recommended to run MySQL tuner periodically, especially after significant changes to your MySQL server or its workload.

For optimal results, run the script after your server has been running for at least 24 hours to gather sufficient performance data.

**Question: How do I interpret the results from MySQL tuner ?**

MySQL tuner provides output in the form of suggestions and warnings.

Review each recommendation and consider implementing the changes in your MySQL configuration file (usually 'my.cnf' or 'my.ini').

Be cautious when making changes and always backup your configuration file before making any modifications.

**Question: Can MySQL tuner cause harm to my database or server ?**

While MySQL tuner itself will not make any changes to your server, blindly implementing its recommendations without understanding the impact can cause issues.

Always ensure you understand the implications of each suggestion before applying it to your server.

**Question: Can I use MySQL tuner for optimizing other database systems like PostgreSQL or SQL Server ?**

MySQL tuner is specifically designed for MySQL servers.
To optimize other database systems, you would need to use tools designed for those systems, such as pgTune for PostgreSQL or SQL Server's built-in performance tools.

**Question: Does MySQL tuner support MariaDB and Percona Server ?**

Yes, MySQL tuner supports MariaDB and Percona Server since they are derivatives of MySQL and share a similar architecture. The script can analyze and provide recommendations for these systems as well.

**Question: What should I do if I need help with MySQL tuner or have questions about the recommendations ?**

If you need help with MySQL tuner or have questions about the recommendations provided by the script, you can consult the MySQL tuner documentation, seek advice from online forums, or consult a MySQL expert.

Be cautious when implementing changes to ensure the stability and performance of your server.

**Question: Will MySQLTuner fix my slow MySQL server ?**

**No.**  MySQLTuner is a read only script.  It won't write to any configuration files, change the status of any daemons.  It will give you an overview of your server's performance and make some basic recommendations for improvements that you can make after it completes.

**Question: Can I fire my DBA now?**

**MySQLTuner will not replace your DBA in any form or fashion.**

If your DBA constantly takes your parking spot and steals your lunch from the fridge, then you may want to consider it - but that's your call.

**Question: Why does MySQLTuner keep asking me the login credentials for MySQL over and over?**

The script will try its best to log in via any means possible.  It will check for ~/.my.cnf files, Plesk password files, and empty password root logins.  If none of those are available, then you'll be prompted for a password.  If you'd like the script to run in an automated fashion without user intervention, then create a .my.cnf file in your home directory which contains:

	[client]
	user=someusername
	password=thatuserspassword

Once you create it, make sure it's owned by your user and the mode on the file is 0600.  This should prevent the prying eyes from getting your database login credentials under normal conditions.

**Question: Is there another way to secure credentials on latest MySQL and MariaDB distributions ?**

You could use mysql_config_editor utilities.
~~~bash
	$ mysql_config_editor set --login-path=client --user=someusername --password --host=localhost
	Enter password: ********
~~~
After which, `~/.mylogin.cnf` will be created with the appropriate access.

To get information about stored credentials, use the following command:

```bash
$mysql_config_editor print
[client]
user = someusername
password = *****
host = localhost
```

**Question: What's minimum privileges needed by a specific mysqltuner user in database ?**

```bash
 mysql>GRANT SELECT, PROCESS,EXECUTE, REPLICATION CLIENT,
 SHOW DATABASES,SHOW VIEW
 ON *.*
 TO 'mysqltuner'@'localhost' identified by pwd1234;
```

**Question: It's not working on my OS! What gives?!**

These kinds of things are bound to happen. Here are the details I need from you to investigate the issue:

* OS and OS version
* Architecture (x86, x86_64, IA64, Commodore 64)
* Exact MySQL version
* Where you obtained your MySQL version (OS package, source, etc)
* The full text of the error
* A copy of SHOW VARIABLES and SHOW GLOBAL STATUS output (if possible)

**Question: How to perform CVE vulnerability checks?**

* Download vulnerabilities.csv from this repository.
* use option --cvefile to perform CVE checks

**Question: How to use mysqltuner from a remote host?**
Thanks to  [@rolandomysqldba](http://dba.stackexchange.com/users/877/rolandomysqldba)

* You will still have to connect like a mysql client:

Connection and Authentication

	--host <hostname> Connect to a remote host to perform tests (default: localhost)
	--socket <socket> Use a different socket for a local connection
	--port <port>     Port to use for connection (default: 3306)
	--user <username> Username to use for authentication
	--pass <password> Password to use for authentication
	--defaults-file <path> defaults file for credentials

Since you are using a remote host, use parameters to supply values from the OS

	--forcemem <size>  Amount of RAM installed in megabytes
	--forceswap <size> Amount of swap memory configured in megabytes

* You may have to contact your remote SysAdmin to ask how much RAM and swap you have

If the database has too many tables, or very large table, use this:

	--skipsize           Don't enumerate tables and their types/sizes (default: on)
	                     (Recommended for servers with many tables)

**Question: Can I install this project using homebrew on Apple Macintosh?**

Yes! `brew install mysqltuner` can be used to install this application using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on Apple Macintosh.
